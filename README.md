# Neural-Solutions-for-Delivery-Optimization

This research focuses on optimizing supply chain operations by leveraging neural network models to predict the risk of late delivery and enhance overall delivery efficiency. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from DataCo Global, machine learning techniques are applied to forecast binary and categorical target variables. The analysis incorporates factors such as shipping times, sales data, customer geographical information, and product details. Through robust performance evaluation measures, the study ensures the predictive power of the models, emphasizing their ability to accurately forecast delivery timelinesâ€”a critical aspect for both customer satisfaction and logistical efficiency. The findings provide valuable, actionable insights for preemptive measures, reinforcing the reliability of supply chain processes in the context of late delivery risk prediction using neural networks.
